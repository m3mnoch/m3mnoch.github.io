&lt;p&gt;however, this one is different!  i actually have a legitimate reason to blog&amp;nbsp;now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;lookit me!  i&amp;#8217;m a&amp;nbsp;writer!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at least, i&amp;#8217;m doing it as a easy-to-put-down-and-pick-back-up outlet for this &lt;em&gt;wellspring&lt;/em&gt; of creativity i have going.  and i&amp;#8217;ve always enjoyed writing, so getting deeper into the craft is&amp;nbsp;cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;what kind of stuff am i going to&amp;nbsp;write?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nice of you to ask!  basically, i&amp;#8217;m a genre writer &amp;#8212; mostly fantasy.  maybe a little sci-fi.  maybe a little horror.  hell, i may even get into that weird urban&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;/fistpump&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;what&amp;#8217;s with the weird domain?  topher chapman?&amp;nbsp;what?!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, now that i&amp;#8217;m well on my way to becoming one of those super-famous writers, i was thinking it was time to stake out a mostly recognizable and sorta-kinda unique pen&amp;nbsp;name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it came down to a choice between &amp;#8220;topher chapman&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;astropants starshine&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; so you can tell which side of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THAT&lt;/span&gt; fence i came down&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;what are all these old&amp;nbsp;posts?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;since i&amp;#8217;ve got lots of random writing laying around all over the place from some 20 years of blogging, (i started back when they were called &amp;#8220;online diaries&amp;#8221; and they had a &amp;#8216;~&amp;#8217; in the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://mediaphex.com/~chris"&gt;url mapping&lt;/a&gt; to my home directory &amp;#8212; ahhhh&amp;#8230;  the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000817183454/http://www.m3mnoch.com/"&gt;good ol&amp;#8217; days&lt;/a&gt;) i figured i&amp;#8217;d reach out and grab a few of the more pertinent, and less aggro-inducing posts and copy them over&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or maybe just any old thing that seems&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway, &lt;a href="mailto:chris@topherchapman.com"&gt;drop me a line&lt;/a&gt; if you have any comments or such.  i&amp;#8217;d love to hear&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>

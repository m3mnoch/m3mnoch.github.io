&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;technology greatly increases the commoditization of goods and&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thanks to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossen%27s_laws"&gt;gossen’s laws&lt;/a&gt;, we know that as commodity consumption rises, marginal utility eventually falls to zero and reaches maximum total&amp;nbsp;utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if total utility is zero (or even close to zero) amongst all things, there is no differentiation between similar goods and&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with no differentiation and the ability to consume goods and services ulitmately limited by time (the one, true finite resource), demand is also&amp;nbsp;finite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;supply-side economics is broken because it relies on temporary increases in total utility when total utility is already&amp;nbsp;maximized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whew…  that’s about all the economic brain cells i have right now.  tho, feel free to point out weird missing strawman&amp;nbsp;holes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Answering Questions About Solar Panels for Your Home</title><link href="/blog/2011/May/10/solar-questions/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-05-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Topher Chapman</name></author><id>tag:,2011-05-10:blog/2011/May/10/solar-questions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;going in, we had (and met) three&amp;nbsp;goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;No added expense&lt;/em&gt; - we didn’t want to be saddled with any extra payments and we assuredly didn’t want to trade liquid cash for a non-liquid asset. there was no way we wanted to wait forever for our investment to recoup. to avoid that, we calculated how many solar panels we’d need to leave our total monthly energy payment unchanged. so, the total of our loan payment added to the new power bill ($10 to $30 a month, depending) is less than or equal to our old power&amp;nbsp;bill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;adding equity to our home&lt;/em&gt; - talk about instant equity!  &amp;#8220;here person buying our house, i hope you like your $15 a month electric bill!“  over the course of 30 years, that’s $54,000 in savings if energy prices stay the&amp;nbsp;same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;saving money long term&lt;/em&gt; - speaking of energy prices staying the same. did you know that power rates in 1990 out here were 9.9 cents per kilowatt hour? now, they’re 15.38 cents. yeah… that’s a 50% increase. and next year, they’re going up to 15.57 and the year after that, the power company is saying they’re going to be 15.61. for those keeping track at home, that’s about a 2% increase per year. not for&amp;nbsp;us!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you’ll notice i didn’t say &amp;#8220;being green”, tho, that’s a nice side effect, it certainly wasn’t the driving reason. it’s funny how many people think we did it because we’re crazy californian hippies. makes me laugh. no, it has nothing to do with that at all. i mean, have you looked at your power bill&amp;nbsp;lately?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;joc did tons and tons of research prior to the install and we ended up choosing marie phillip at herca solar here in san diego (&lt;a href="http://www.hercasolar.com"&gt;http://www.hercasolar.com&lt;/a&gt;) – they were awesome and are highly recommended by us to anyone interested. just tell them joc and i sent&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, to recap: our monthly power budget at worst (until the loan is paid off) is a little less than before the panels, we added a ton of equity to the house and we’ve insulated ourselves from future power rate increases. win, win and&amp;nbsp;win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hell, all we need now is an electric car and we’ll be the hippies with the $15 power bill to your $200 one and our $0.00 a month fuel bill to your $200 one.
tho, i suppose at least you won’t be called a&amp;nbsp;hippy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>

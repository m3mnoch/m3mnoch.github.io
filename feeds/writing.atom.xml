&lt;p&gt;long story short (ha!  see what i did there?!?), it&amp;#8217;s a device that works well with&amp;nbsp;comedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i can totes do&amp;nbsp;funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, yeah, this month was fun to write.  originally, i was planning on doing a zombie hunter thing &amp;#8212; had a great nugget of an idea that i may revive (see?  funny!) later.  that&amp;#8217;s when i remembered a conversation my d&amp;amp;d guys and i had ages ago.  it involved dragons, so, of course, i wrote about&amp;nbsp;dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;finally, here it is:  &lt;a href="/stories/fucking-dragon"&gt;But, I’m a F#@%ing&amp;nbsp;Dragon!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>

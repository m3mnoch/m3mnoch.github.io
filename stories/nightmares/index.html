    <p>The double doors on the breezeway swung wide as Jordan strode through to the ground-floor atrium of Jefferson High School. It was Monday, and he was ready for his biology test. He&#8217;d never felt more prepared for a&nbsp;test. </p>
<p>Glancing down at his watch, he made note of the time, 7:58 <span class="caps">AM</span>. He still had two minutes to walk the paltry 30 feet down the hall to Mrs. Beale&#8217;s room before the bell rang. He started whistling the chorus from <em>Good Times</em>. </p>
<p>Laughter broke out and stopped his tune. At first it was a few titters and giggles, but soon the long, loud belly laughs boomed through the&nbsp;chamber. </p>
<p>Standing in the center of the large atrium, Jordan glanced up to the balconies above. Rows of students lined the railings, pointing and laughing at him. Along all three&nbsp;floors. </p>
<p><em>Shouldn&#8217;t they be in&nbsp;class?</em> </p>
<p>Looking down to check the time again, he noticed his pants were gone. Jordan frantically patted his chest and sides &#8212; He wore only underwear, the stupid purple ones from his grandmother even, as everyone stared at him. Worse, there wasn&#8217;t time to race home and change before his&nbsp;test. </p>
<p><em>Hell, looks like I&#8217;m taking this test in <span class="caps">STYLE</span>.</em> </p>
<p>Music kicked on over the P.A., and Jordan started doing the electric slide, shuffling and spinning right out of the atrium and down the hall. Heads bobbed. Girls swooned. And applause followed him all the way into Mrs.&nbsp;Beale&#8217;s. </p>
<hr />
<p>Jordan walked along the boardwalk with Chrissy, arm-in-arm, and enjoyed the soft glow of the street lamps. It was quiet and they were in love. He couldn&#8217;t wait to marry this girl because she was the first one who truly understood him. Supported&nbsp;him. </p>
<p><em>My&nbsp;soulmate.</em> </p>
<p>They stopped by the benches on the pier. It was a sleepy spot where they could be alone. Looking up at him, Chrissy&#8217;s eyes glittered with adoration. She was incredible. And she was his. Jordan brushed a wisp of red hair from her face and leaned in to kiss&nbsp;her. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Gimme your money.&nbsp;Now.&#8221; </p>
<p>The voice came from behind him. Jordan spun, stepping in front of Chrissy protectively, and saw the grubby man pointing a pistol at&nbsp;them. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Now,&#8221; he&nbsp;repeated. </p>
<p>Without a moment of hesitation, Jordan dug into his pockets and yanked out a wad of ones and fives. He shoved the wrinkled bills at the mugger, and lifted his hands in the&nbsp;air. </p>
<p><em>Please just go&nbsp;away.</em> </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>That&#8217;s all you got? I guess you&#8217;re gonna have to watch me take some from your girl. My way.&#8221; The man pointed the gun at Jordan&#8217;s face and thumbed back the hammer. &#8220;Get on your knees.&nbsp;Now.&#8221; </p>
<p><em>This is <span class="caps">NOT</span>&nbsp;happening.</em> </p>
<p>Jordan swiped at the gun, fast and clean, with his left hand, fingers wrapping over the top of the barrel, and twisted the weapon back toward the mugger. At the same time, he landed a savage kick to the man&#8217;s bladder. The creep grunted, and released his already-slipping grip on the pistol. Ripping the weapon away, Jordan smashed the butt into the robber&#8217;s face. Blood erupted and the man crumbled to his&nbsp;knees. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>You won&#8217;t touch <em>my</em> girl, bitch.&#8221; Jordan aimed the pistol and the man&#8217;s&nbsp;head. </p>
<p><span class="caps">BOOM</span>, <span class="caps">BOOM</span>. </p>
<hr />
<p>The view was exhilarating. Standing on the ledge, Jordan staggered at the height. It must have been over 150 stories of empty space running down glass windows, terminated at a sidewalk covered in ant-like&nbsp;pedestrians. </p>
<p><em>Good thing I&#8217;m not afraid of&nbsp;heights.</em> </p>
<p>Jordan lifted his palms to the sky, basking in the fresh air and sunshine. It was the start of a beautiful day and he shone with&nbsp;life. </p>
<p>A sharp shove sent him tumbling from the rooftop and the world&nbsp;spun. </p>
<p>Terror draped thick over Jordan and he wailed as his body whistled through morning sunbeams, spiraling toward the unsuspecting strangers at the base of the building. He screamed until he had no more breath, and choked on the rush of wind battering at his&nbsp;face. </p>
<p>The fall was far. Still only halfway to the streets below, he had a few seconds left to&nbsp;steal. </p>
<p>Noticing four awnings making a neat row off to his right, he knew what to do. Body steeling, he spread his arms, caught the breeze, controlled his fall, and almost&nbsp;glided. </p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve got this. <span class="caps">INCOMING</span>!</em> </p>
<p>Jordan burst through the first awning, snapped through the second, ripped the third, and peeled the fourth from its supports. He finished with a muffled crunch as he thumped into a&nbsp;dumpster. </p>
<p>Disentangling from the ragged canvas clinging to him, he pulled himself up and out of the trash. He leapt down to the sidewalk, and bobbed his head to the gawking&nbsp;onlookers. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Hi.&#8221; He grinned. &#8220;How you&nbsp;doin&#8217;?&#8221; </p>
<hr />
<p>Jordan stormed through the alley, feet stomping puddles and refuse. As he cut through the drizzle, he struggled to remember what he was running from. He only knew it terrified&nbsp;him. </p>
<p>A groan echoed around the corner ahead of him and he splashed to a stop. Jordan glanced back as snarls rolled along the walls from the direction he&#8217;d come. He was&nbsp;trapped. </p>
<p><em>There has to be a way&nbsp;out.</em> </p>
<p>Frantic, his head pivoted as he searched, shuffling side to side, from wall to wall in the tight back street. There was no where to go. No windows. No fire escapes. No doors. It was solid brick to either&nbsp;side. </p>
<p>Another growl and his attention snapped to the mouth of the alley and the shadows lurking at the corner. Spinning to face the opposite end, he watched angry dark figures pierce the light spilling from a&nbsp;cross-street. </p>
<p>Instead, Jordan looked for a weapon in the strewn garbage, anything of use in defending himself. In his sweep, he noticed a dumpster he hadn&#8217;t seen before and his hopes spiked&nbsp;high. </p>
<p><em>I can hide in&nbsp;there.</em> </p>
<p>He rushed over, threw open the lid, and a figure shot up from the darkness inside. A snarling, rotted monster with greasy hands grabbed at his head. Jordan lurched backwards, tripped, and flailed to the&nbsp;asphalt. </p>
<p>The zombie crawled slowly from the trash bin, as Jordan splayed in a puddle, paralyzed with fear. He needed to get up and&nbsp;run. </p>
<p><em>I <span class="caps">HAVE</span> to get out of&nbsp;here!</em> </p>
<p>Both openings of the alley were filled with zombies now, huge crowds at either end, shuffling toward him. Back in the dumpster, another decayed face appeared and started crawling out. Then another. And&nbsp;another. </p>
<p>The first one, putrid and dripping ichor, reached out and dug torn, yellow fingernails into his leg. Jordan couldn&#8217;t pull&nbsp;away. </p>
<p>He&nbsp;screamed. </p>
<hr />
<p>Jordan stormed through the alley, feet stomping puddles and refuse. As he cut through the drizzle, he struggled to remember what he was running from. He only knew it terrified him&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>See? There&#8217;s an art to it. Agility and art.&#8221; Dr. Keltzer stepped back, hands on hips, and admired his work. &#8220;The resource&#8217;s heart rate is back up to 153 <span class="caps">BPM</span> and the LEDs are all&nbsp;green.&#8221; </p>
<p>He tapped out a cheery rhythm on the tile floor with his Oxford, and eyed the nearly 50 foot long wall containing all of the fright-bays for Quadrant 34D. The bays were laid out four high and sixteen wide, and all but this one thrummed happily&nbsp;along. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Now, we lock it in.&#8221; The doctor punched a few keys to commit the nightmare to the <span class="caps">JCF</span>-488&#8217;s memory bank. Turning to the technician originally operating the station, &#8220;However, make sure you&#8217;re throwing in slight variations now and again. That will help keep its mind off&nbsp;balance.&#8221; </p>
<p>With the final keystroke, the hydraulic lift whined and Bay-28 glided up and back into its Baysocket. The human clone quickly joined its 63 neighbors in comfortable&nbsp;productivity. </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Which other resource did you say was at struggling with&nbsp;output?&#8221; </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Quadrant 722B, Bay-17. Its only running at 2.35 FrightBits per&nbsp;second.&#8221; </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>That low? Goodness. Let&#8217;s hop in the cart and head over. Maybe see if we can craft a better nightmare or two, shall&nbsp;we?&#8221; </p>

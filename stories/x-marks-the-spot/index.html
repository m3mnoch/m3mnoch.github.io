    <p>“Why can’t we skip straight to the ‘X’?  We know where the pirate treasure is.  We can see it on the&nbsp;map.”</p>
<p>“It’s about the journey, man!  We’re gonna do this&nbsp;right.”</p>
<p>Terrance stopped midway through pushing a vine out of his face and stole a backward glance at their little boat, beached and empty.  Not only was he going to regret all of this, but he was probably going to get bitten by a disease-laden insect.  Facing Will again, he tossed the vine away and trudged on, “But, the guy had a dozen other maps.  For crying out loud, he was wearing a&nbsp;hoodie.”</p>
<p>“That’s because you didn’t notice the fact this one was different from the other maps.  Unlike this one, they all had duplicates.”   Will winked at Terrance, tapping the side of his head with his index finger, “But, <em>I</em>&nbsp;noticed.”</p>
<p>The two men halted in a clearing — Will, with his hands on hips, grinned at the choking foliage, Terrance, stretching his back with a groan,&nbsp;winced.</p>
<p>“I think we’re here.”  Will approached an outcropping of dense&nbsp;scrub.</p>
<p>“Huh?”  Terrance studied the glade while Will pawed through the&nbsp;leaves.</p>
<p>“Ah &#8230; We are.”  Will, gripping the machete, pulled back a handful of branches and lopped them off.  “Look at&nbsp;this.”</p>
<p>It was a wide stone wall.  Now that Terrance got a good look, it stretched upwards, lost in the tree canopy.  Thirty or forty feet of jungle-covered&nbsp;granite.</p>
<p>“It’s about the right shape, I guess.  And, it’s certainly big enough.  So,&nbsp;sure.”</p>
<p>“Whoa.  Check this out.”  Will was clearing moss and clusters of leaves from the base of the now-recognizable obelisk.  There was some sort of ape or monkey carved into the stone knee height from the ground.  “A&nbsp;monkey.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see any monkeys on the map.  Are you sure this is the right&nbsp;place?”</p>
<p>“Of course.  It’s not like giant, carved towers just appear naturally in jungles.  I’m absolutely sure.”  Will rolled up the map and shoved it into his back pocket.  “North, we&nbsp;go.”</p>
<hr />
<p>“That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”  Palms stinging, Terrance swung the machete and attacked the damp&nbsp;undergrowth.</p>
<p>“It’s only dumb because you’re not rich.  When we find all that gold, I’ll be able to afford any medicine or medical procedures I’ll ever want.”  Will upended his canteen and gulped down a mouthful of water.  “That means, if I want to only eat cinnamon toast, I can.  I’ll just take vitamins too and then have the doctors suck all my fat out.  Problem&nbsp;solved.”</p>
<p>“But, you can’t just eat cinnamon toast&nbsp;forever.”</p>
<p>“I sure can.  And I will.  With lots of butter,&nbsp;even.”</p>
<p>“No.  You can’t.  Your body will, like, dissolve or something.  You need&nbsp;vegetables.”</p>
<p>“That’s what the vitamins are&nbsp;for.”</p>
<p>Terrance stopped talking.  He continued hacking at the vines, imagining they were the synapses in Will’s&nbsp;brain.</p>
<p>“When you’re rich, you can do whatever you want.  I mean, <em>you’re</em> probably going to do something dumb with your half of the treasure.  Like, buy a library or&nbsp;something.”</p>
<p>Terrance stopped mid-chop.  “Buy a&nbsp;what?”</p>
<p>“You’ll probably buy a library.  They don’t make any money, so you can write it off on your&nbsp;taxes.”</p>
<p>“Aside from libraries being public property paid for by taxes, if it’s not making any money, there’s no income to tax, and no write-off to be had.  That’s almost as dumb as the cinnamon toast thing.”  Terrance turned back to lopping vines with renewed vigor.  His thirty minutes was almost up, then it would be Will’s turn to swing the stupid machete.  “No, I’ll probably invest my share of this non-existent&nbsp;gold.”</p>
<p>“People like libraries.  Or buy a city park.  Just not a pub.  The food cost alone would sink&nbsp;it.”</p>
<p>“That’s not how any of this works, Will.  Assuming we find a buyer for these priceless gems and jewelery, the government is going to take out a bunch in taxes&nbsp;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“See?  I told you.  Tax&nbsp;deductions.”</p>
<p>“&#8230; And I’ll invest the rest.  Probably live off of dividends or the principle or something.  That way I’m not&nbsp;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“There it is!  The&nbsp;canyon!”</p>
<p>Terrance assumed he was supposed to be excited to see the chasm, but at this point, he was almost hoping Will would tumble over the edge.  His hand twitched.  One little&nbsp;shove.</p>
<p>The “bridge”, swaying in the wind, sagged across the canyon in front of them.  Far below, a river frothed through the gorge in jagged switchbacks, waiting to swallow travelers stupid enough to try the flimsy rope and&nbsp;planks.</p>
<p>Terrance scowled at Will.  “Are you kidding&nbsp;me?”</p>
<p>Will shrugged, “What?  You wanted&nbsp;adventure.”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t.  You did.  We’re going to die the moment we set foot on that bridge.”  Terrance pointed to the bridge as it curled and flipped in the wind.  “And I’m going to scream your middle name to the <em>entire</em> world the <em>entire</em> time we’re falling to our&nbsp;deaths.”</p>
<p>“Whoa, easy.  There’s no need for threats.”  Eyebrows high and arms in the air, he faced Terrance, then pointed.  “Besides, see?  There’s our monkey friend.  We’re going to be safe as a babe in a&nbsp;barrel.”</p>
<p>Terrance sighed, ignoring thoughts of babies trapped in barrels of oranges or nails or diesel. Instead, he glanced down to where Will gestured, at the base of the wide stone pillars where the various ropes from the bridge attached.  Indeed, there was the same monkey figure from the first marker, and it was carved into the rock near the cliff’s&nbsp;edge.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, you’re going&nbsp;first.”</p>
<hr />
<p>“Seriously, we could have skipped both Bug Jungle <em>and</em> Wet Noodle Bridge.  And, we&#8217;d have already been here by now.”  Standing in front of a dark hole in the base of a cliff, Terrance jerked a thumb over his shoulder.  “Our boat is beached about half a mile that&nbsp;way.”</p>
<p>“But think of the fun we’d have missed.”  Will hunched, and crept into the&nbsp;darkness.</p>
<p>“You mean the malaria we’d have missed?”  Terrance followed close, hand on his friend’s&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Bird&nbsp;flu?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“How about Zika?  I hear you can get that from&nbsp;bats.”</p>
<p>Something small winged by their heads, screeching, and they slammed together, toppling against the wall, and nearly falling to the stone&nbsp;floor.</p>
<p>“When we get back, I’m telling your mom that you’re being a Negative Nelly&nbsp;again.”</p>
<p>“I’m telling your mom you’re trying to make your own decisions&nbsp;again.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m telling your sister &#8230; Wait.  Is that light up&nbsp;ahead?”</p>
<p>As the two shuffled forward, Terrance watched as the flicker grew more distinct.  It was definitely a torch, like one in the movies, and it was clipped to the corner before the tunnel widened into a large&nbsp;recess.</p>
<p>A man stood in the middle of the firelight, pointing a pistol at the two of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Terrance frowned, “Hey,&nbsp;Frank.”</p>
<p>“Hi, Terrance.&#8221;  He nodded.&nbsp;&#8220;Will.”</p>
<p>Will scrubbed his face with his hands and mumbled, “Oh yeah, I forgot.  I may have shown the map to Frank before we&nbsp;left.”</p>
<p>“I guess unlike you two, I came straight here, and expected you guys to already have the treasure.  So, I brought this —“  Frank twirled his gun.  “— That way I could take it from you.  Lucky for me, now I can force you to carry the gold out for&nbsp;me.”</p>
<p>“Good going, Will.”  Terrance flipped his leg out and kicked Will in the&nbsp;shin.</p>
<p>Will grunted.  “Ow.&nbsp;Jerk.”</p>
<p>Lowering the gun, Frank shook his head and turned to continue down the dark tunnel beyond, chuckling, “‘X’ marks the spot,&nbsp;boys.”</p>
<p>Frank clicked on a flashlight with his other hand and vanished around the first bend.  “I’ll be right back, so don’t go&nbsp;anywhere.”</p>
<p>With him gone, Terrance looked around the tiny cave and noticed, for the first time, the ornate ‘X’ carved above the tunnel where Frank had disappeared.  He pointed at it and glowered at Will.  “Not only should we have come straight here, but you shouldn’t have shown him the&nbsp;map.”</p>
<p>Staring at the ground, Will shuffled his&nbsp;feet.</p>
<p>A scream, loud and strong, ripped through the tunnel to end in a sharp&nbsp;snap.</p>
<p>The flashlight Frank had been carrying bounced back out of the mouth of the tunnel and rolled, causing the cavern walls to swim and weave in the light until it finally rocked to a stop.  There, exposed by the beam, was a smaller crawlspace behind Will, hidden in the shadows, on the opposite side of the carved&nbsp;‘X’.</p>
<p>The entrance had the same monkey carved near the bottom of the&nbsp;opening.</p>
<p>Terrance and Will faced each other, their wide-eyed shock simultaneously turning into wide, toothy&nbsp;grins.</p>
<p>Will bent and scooped up the flashlight, got down on this knees, and crawled into the hole.  Heartbeats after he disappeared from view, an echo drifted back out of the small opening, “Holy mother of &#8230; Get in here!  We&#8217;re&nbsp;rich!”</p>
<p>Terrance glanced to the other opening.  &#8220;Sorry &#8216;bout that Frank.  Everyone knows you never go straight to the&nbsp;&#8216;X&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

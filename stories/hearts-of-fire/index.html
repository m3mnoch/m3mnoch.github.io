<div class="span5 element readingColumn">
    <p>Helmet secured, the diver disappeared beneath the surface of the water as he pulled himself along the body of the dragon.  A fresh lashing of ropes and hanger bolts, barely visible in the twilight, traced a path to the underside of the floating&nbsp;remains.</p>
<p>“He’s retrieving it from underwater?”  Dr. Nina Fleming, having finally been allowed on deck, stood at the rail and watched foam swirl where the diver&nbsp;disappeared.</p>
<p>She’d heard the battle had been short and fierce, but ultimately, the large cannons had brought down the predator.  The massive, black dragon had launched into the air from the volcanic island, and had strafed the ships in its path with fire while naval gunmen had peppered it with the ship&#8217;s smaller calibre anti-aircraft guns.  Eventually, several 30-centimeter rounds from the primary cannons had ripped holes through the beast, it&#8217;s dragon armor hide resisting like so much balsa.  It had fallen, splashing into the&nbsp;waves.</p>
<p>Rough measurements showed it to be the largest dragon discovered in the twenty years since the first ones had appeared.  Despite all their flurry and study since, scientists couldn&#8217;t agree on why the beasts had started roaming the world as there was no reliable record of them ever&nbsp;existing.</p>
<p>It was 1923 and <em>there were dragons</em>.</p>
<p>But even this, the most massive predator in all of history, wasn&#8217;t equipped to defend against the weaponry on board this modern battleship.  The dragon had no path to victory as the sea water and some 40 centimeters of steel armor was all it had taken to prevent most of the damage from flames.  And once the fire-fueled shouts had died down, the relatively few main deck sailors who were injured, now rested in the ship&#8217;s infirmary, their burns receiving attention mere minutes after the attack.  She marveled at the efficiency.  The tidiness of it&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>“We have the finest salvage team in the Navy on board.”  The Master Diver leaned forward and pointed to a stiff hose as it uncoiled and extended, following the diver into the ocean.  “They’re like Rembrandt with those arc&nbsp;welders.”</p>
<p>She recrossed her arms.  “And, what if he accidentally hits the&nbsp;heart?”</p>
<p>“He won’t,&nbsp;ma’am.”</p>
<p>Bright flashes of light flickered in the sea at the edges of the dragon’s corpse.  The waves bubbled and churned a cloudy red, backlit by the diver’s welding&nbsp;torch.</p>
<p>Nina found it difficult to tell if the red-washed ocean was due to the sunset or dragon blood.  As the only dragon discovered in the last three years, the enormous corpse bleeding out in the water was probably the last.  At least the last of them this fleet would need to deal&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>Another bloom of light, and she couldn’t watch&nbsp;anymore.</p>
<p>Turning away from the salvage operation, she stalked back to where her green-looking partner and fellow Dragon Recovery Agent leaned against the bridge superstructure.  Sure he was bright and nice to look at, but he had no sense of discipline or what it took to succeed in this world.  Unfortunately, he was here to protect&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>He wiped his mouth and looked up with watery eyes as she approached.  Her first mission, and their first together, had been escorting dragon hearts with tanks and jeeps to the new <span class="caps">DRA</span> facility.  She shook her head, remembering how that trip had been gentler on his apparently tender&nbsp;stomach.</p>
<p>“I feel sorry for the poor sod who’s going to have to swab this deck.”  He made the mistake of glancing down, and dry heaved again.  “Man, the galley porridge looks the same coming back up, doesn’t&nbsp;it?”</p>
<p>“That’s disgusting,&nbsp;Frankie.”</p>
<p>“Probably tastes the same,&nbsp;too.”</p>
<p>Nina scowled at him.  “Are you quite done?  We need to find the Admiral.  This operation is a travesty.  They’re taking every opportunity available to destroy that&nbsp;harvest.”</p>
<p>“Harvest?  You mean first killing, then retrieving the once-beating heart of a 200-ton, kicking, thrashing, flying, fire-breathing monster?  And they’re making a mess of it?”  Frankie squinted at her.  “Incompetent fools,&nbsp;anyway.”</p>
<p>“You know what I&nbsp;mean.”</p>
<p>“This is your first field assignment, isn’t&nbsp;it?”</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>No.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>That last ride along doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;count.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Fine.  Yes, this is my first <em>real</em> field assignment.  But I’m the leading expert on the extraction process.  I&#8217;ve done hundreds of hours of simulated extractions in my lab.  I even&nbsp;wrote—“</p>
<p>“I’ll just take that as ‘Yes, Field Agent Frankie, because I’m just Dr. Fleming, the lab&nbsp;geek.’”</p>
<p>“This coming from the tough guy who just lost his&nbsp;breakfast?”</p>
<p>“Hey now, do I look like a boat-loving fisherman to you?”  Frankie looked down to see three chunky bits clinging to the grip of his holstered .44 magnum, and groaned.&nbsp;“Ew.”</p>

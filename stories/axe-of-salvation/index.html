<div class="span5 element readingColumn">
    <p>The line, formed from gray, shambling humanity, stretched down the cobbled street. The Midday Offertory Prayer typically finished within an hour, but was running long. Worse, it felt like the sun had already baked the inhabitants of Refuge after the first fifteen minutes waiting their turn outside the church. Sweat salted the donation marks on their throats, making the ritual even more delicious for the Vampires of&nbsp;Faith.</p>
<p>Unlike the others gathered, Edmund and Rose were not donating&nbsp;today.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Edmund, I feel dizzy.&#8221; Rose, knuckles to her forehead, staggered. &#8220;This heat is&nbsp;unbearable.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Let&#8217;s get you some water, dear.&#8221; Edmund guided her out of line, through the gate, and over to the well in the cathedral&nbsp;courtyard.</p>
<p>Rose sat in the shade and fanned herself while he brought over a small cup of water. The couple waited until the crowd had completely turned over before exiting the opposite side, following the lethargic people fresh from their blood&nbsp;donation.</p>
<p>This was the fourth day in a row they&#8217;d avoided the Offertory. The two felt hearty, healthy, and warm as their strength&nbsp;built.</p>
<p>Strength enough to ascend the outer wall. They would make the climb and see Ruin for&nbsp;themselves.</p>
<p>The teachings of the Vampires of Faith claim two centuries ago a devastating battle was waged beyond the wall. Through great sacrifice, the vampires saved humanity from Ruin and oversaw the building of Refuge &#8212; the last stronghold of&nbsp;mankind.</p>
<p>Refuge was enormous, containing the farm district and livestock pens where most everyone labored, small homes, the Church of Faith, everything. Surrounded by a ten meter wall holding Ruin at&nbsp;bay.</p>
<p>Edmund and Rose shambled down the street leading to their shanty, careful to appear as weak and drained as the others. Tonight, they would be free of this&nbsp;prison.</p>
<p>They would prove the rumors&nbsp;true.</p>
<hr />
<p>Rose stood at the corner, peering around the hovel, as she searched for anyone that might interrupt them. They&#8217;d found two abandoned homes tucked back in the outer neighborhood, backing up against the wall, and providing cover from nighttime&nbsp;passersby.</p>
<p><em><span class="caps">CLANG</span>!</em></p>
<p>That had been his third throw. He should have worked the iron into more than a single&nbsp;hook.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>How much longer?&#8221; Rose whispered from her&nbsp;corner.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>As long as it takes to get over.&#8221; Edmund threw his hook&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>They both watched as it arced over the wall but, after a tug, flipped up and fell back to crash onto the roof of the left&nbsp;shack.</p>
<p>Rose shook her head at him and, turning back to watch the street, hissed, &#8220;There&#8217;s a Grey&nbsp;coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greys were zealots. Handpicked for their idolatry and tasked with maintaining order in Refuge among places the Vampires didn&#8217;t travel. According to rumor, they even donated twice&nbsp;daily.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Oy! What do you think you&#8217;re doing?&#8221; The <em><span class="caps">SCHLIK</span></em> of a sword clearing its scabbard echoed through the silent streets. The only Refuge residents allowed access to weapons were&nbsp;Greys.</p>
<p>Edmund&nbsp;hesitated.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Run!&#8221; Rose&nbsp;screamed.</p>
<p>Jolted to action, he grabbed Rose&#8217;s hand and sprinted out of the alley before they were&nbsp;trapped.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Hey!&nbsp;Stop!&#8221;</p>
<p>Muscles pumping with blood-fueled strength, the couple streaked down the street. The wind slashed through their hair as they angled around the block to leave the Grey streets away. The speed and power Edmund now possessed was exhilarating.&nbsp;Inhuman.</p>
<p>The smile on Rose&#8217;s face told him she felt it too. They sprinted&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Rounding another corner, they found themselves again at the well in the main cathedral&#8217;s courtyard. He&#8217;d been so caught up with his vitality, his legs had automatically run the well-worn path to the Offertory&nbsp;Gate.</p>
<p>They stopped to rest. To think. An alarm bell rang in the distance. Any moment, half a dozen Grey patrols would stomp through the&nbsp;gate.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>What are we going to do?&#8221; Rose, eyes wide and scanning, spun to face&nbsp;Edmund.</p>
<p>He froze. He didn&#8217;t know what to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>Edmund had planned everything out. Thought he was ready. Yet there he stood, paralyzed, and staring at Rose. His escape plans, his bravery, and his confidence drained out his feet and seeped into the clay-packed&nbsp;dirt.</p>
<p>Rose growled at him. &#8220;You <em>always</em> do this.&#8221; She grabbed Edmund by the arm and dragged him to the well. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a stupid idea. Get&nbsp;in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking the bucket rope from Rose, he locked eyes with her. &#8220;I&#8217;m&nbsp;sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Hush. Just get&nbsp;in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two climbed into the well and struggled down the rope as Greys stormed the courtyard&nbsp;above.</p>
<p>Five meters below the stone lip, a small tunnel opened into the well. Examining the outward slant of the opening, Edmund assumed it was some sort of runoff conduit in case the well overflowed. It became their escape&nbsp;plan.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>In here.&#8221; He pointed to the hole. &#8220;We can wait for the Greys to give up. We&#8217;ll even be home by&nbsp;dawn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pushing off the opposite wall, Edmund flopped into the tunnel. With the slope steeper and the limestone slicker than anticipated, he slid, uncontrolled, for a terrifying handful of seconds before finally firing out into&nbsp;emptiness.</p>
<p>He fell, arms&nbsp;flailing.</p>
<p>Three meters of open space and he splashed into a dark lake filling a large, low-lit cavern. Edmund kicked with his legs, pulled hard, and burst the&nbsp;surface.</p>
<p>The basin was enormous, entirely filled by the lake except for a ledge that ran along the far side, 120 meters away. A trickling drip somewhere in the darkness had been distracting him when he noticed the coppery taste of the thick, brackish water. Edmund realized it wasn&#8217;t&nbsp;water.</p>
<p>It was years of&nbsp;blood.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edmund had climbed the ladder&#8217;s metal rungs until he could see into the hole in the cavern ceiling. Rose trailed close behind&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>After splashing into the lake of blood, they&#8217;d swum, buoyant in the dark, dense liquid, and finally pulled themselves up on the distant ledge. They had found the iron ladder, running up into the black above and had started&nbsp;climbing.</p>
<p>At the top of the ladder, drenched and dripping with blood, Edmund toiled up through the&nbsp;opening.</p>
<p>He entered a dusty room, dark aside from a sputtering torch in a sconce. Edmund bent and grabbed Rose&#8217;s blood-slick hand, helping her up into the room. They stood, soaked and anchored with&nbsp;dread.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Where are we?&#8221; Rose&nbsp;asked.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I <em>think</em> we&#8217;re below the cathedral.&#8221; Edmund worked the torch from its holder. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen wall sconces like this during&nbsp;prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flashing the weak light about the little room, they spied a door. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get out of&nbsp;here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opening it, Edmund peeked around the corner. The passageway was formed from large-cut stone blocks with two other small, oak doors. It swept to a main set of brass doors at the other end of the&nbsp;corridor.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>This way.&#8221; Gripping her hand, their steps echoed down the&nbsp;hall.</p>
<p>Edmund gently pushed through the double doors, entering into a large sacristy. Desks, containers, and artifacts filled out the space while maps and tapestries, worn and depicting Ruin, hung on the&nbsp;walls.</p>
<p>A pale, corpulent figure in a desk chair flung around at their arrival, rising from his&nbsp;seat.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Who are you? What are you doing&nbsp;here?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a Vampire of&nbsp;Faith.</p>
<p>The monster lurched at a paralyzed, wide-eyed Edmund. Instinctively, he lashed out with his torch, catching the vampire across the jaw. The two tumbled into a pile on the thick&nbsp;carpet.</p>
<p>Edmund rolled the fat beast to the side and crawled out from under its still&nbsp;form.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>What happened?&#8221; Rose covered her mouth with a hand. &#8220;That&#8217;s a&nbsp;vampire!&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Leaning over, he pushed back the lips to reveal two long, sharp incisors. &#8220;It has fangs. It must be a&nbsp;vampire.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>How&#8230; Is it actually dead?&#8221; Rose turned about the room, as if searching for some other&nbsp;reason.</p>
<p>Edmund leaned in closer to examine the teeth. They looked <em>strange</em>. He grasped and snapped off a piece of sharpened ivory exposing a standard tooth beneath. The fang was&nbsp;fake.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Look at this! He&#8217;s got fake teeth. He&#8217;s just a man.&#8221; Edmund stood, displaying the ivory bit to&nbsp;Rose.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Wait until you see this.&#8221; She ripped down a broad parchment tacked to the wall. &#8220;Look at this map. Edmund, we&#8217;re not the only city&nbsp;left.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was right. There were multiple cities marked on the map, some within a few kilometers. All named and numbered Sanctuary 63, Haven 64, Solace 66. They, apparently, were Refuge&nbsp;65.</p>
<p>Rose glanced at the dead &#8220;vampire&#8221;. &#8220;What are we going to&nbsp;do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Edmund walked over to the large plaque for safeguarding the <em>Steel Axe of Salvation</em> used in the yearly ceremony. He lifted it off the hooks and tested the&nbsp;weight.</p>
<p>Rage finally bubbled up. No more hesitation. No more paralysis. He knew exactly what they were going to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>Turning, Edmund faced Rose, axe on his shoulder, and snarled, &#8220;We&#8217;re freeing our&nbsp;people.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stalked to the inner door, the blood from the lake swim now a sticky brown, and kicked it&nbsp;open.</p>

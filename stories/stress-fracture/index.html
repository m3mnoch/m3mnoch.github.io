    <p>The echo was terrible.  She smashed to the flagstones, the crack of breaking bones resounding through her skull.  Her legs shattered, pain exploded, and she nearly cried&nbsp;out.</p>
<p><em>Nearly.  But I&nbsp;didn’t.</em></p>
<p>Arix had fallen from the window ledge of the fourth floor of Magister Veaso&#8217;s mansion.  She laid there, prone, fractured legs on fire, and watched her companions continue into the window through the haze of her&nbsp;pain.</p>
<p>Her vision, swimming a moment, finally straightened.  <em>I have this.  Deep breaths.  Slow deep breaths.</em>  She&#8217;d been so quiet and the fall was so far, she couldn’t be sure if her fellow assassins knew she had&nbsp;fallen.</p>
<p><em>Dammit.  I’m usually more careful.</em>  Now, their mission was botched because she had to go and fall out of a window.  <em>Who does&nbsp;that?</em></p>
<p>She glanced back up to the now empty window.  <em>I do,&nbsp;apparently.</em></p>
<p>Arix steeled herself and tried to sit up.  Shock arced up her arm.  She stiffened, and crashed to her left, her wrist giving way in another spike of pain.  Her vision swam again and blackness threatened to overwhelm&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>Another deep breath and she flexed her fingers, probing with her right hand for damage.  It was her wrist.  She discovered at least a severe sprain and, at the most, it was broken like both of her&nbsp;legs.</p>
<p>She rolled over from her side to her back, still breathing deeply, and forced down the pain.  Smothering it came easier this time as the anger from her failure&nbsp;rose.</p>
<p>Not only did she fail as the group’s designated eyes, but now she couldn’t abort and flee with them when the lack of a lookout compromised the mission.  Discovery, for her, was as inevitable as the magister’s morning walk in the&nbsp;garden.</p>
<p><em>I can see it now.  I’m going to be lying here, all smiles and sharp, protruding bone, “Well, hello.  Would you mind helping a lady up?  What?  No!  Of course I’m not here to assassinate you.  Yes, that hurts.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Please stop kicking&nbsp;me….”</em></p>
<p>Arix laid back, head resting on the cold stone, and closed her eyes.  She let out a sigh, long and windy enough to fill a mainsail, and wondered if this was going to end poorly.  <em>Hell, who am I kidding?  This has already ended&nbsp;poorly.</em></p>
<p><em>And where the hell were Kwoam and Reese?  They should have aborted by now, or at least noticed I’m not with them.</em>  She should have seen them dropping down along the outside of the building and clambering over the wall.  That had been the&nbsp;plan.</p>
<p>A noise caught her attention and her head swiveled toward the gate joining her garden and the inner courtyard.  It was still closed, but was that a dog?  <em>Am I going to be mauled by a dog,&nbsp;too?</em></p>
<p>A heartbeat later, a sharp dog&nbsp;bark.</p>
<p>Arix jerked up.  <em>I’m going to ram my sheered off femur into that dog’s…</em>  The pain hit her and she almost threw up, immediately regretting suddenly flinging herself up.  Arix uncoiled, relaxed back to the ground, and started working on her breathing again.  <em>In.  Hold.&nbsp;Out.</em></p>
<p>In search of a distraction, she turned her head to the side and looked at the flowers off the path, near her hips.  They looked soft.  <em>It would have been nice to land there instead of on this&nbsp;granite.</em></p>
<p>They were pretty.  She thought they were white carnations, although they were tinted the barest blue in the moonlight.  Had the moon been full, Arix suspected they would have been a more surreal and blazing white.  At the moment, however, they looked cold and&nbsp;lonely.</p>
<p>Arix noticed some of the carnations had purple streaks across the petals.  A bit of the purple dripped off a petal.  <em>Ah, it’s blood.  My&nbsp;blood.</em></p>
<p>She looked down at her legs and noticed a dark pool forming on the ground beneath her left thigh.  The jagged bone protruding from the flesh helped to explain why her body threatened to black out every time she moved.  <em>At least my right leg is kind enough not to have bone poking&nbsp;through.</em></p>
<p>She must have landed awkwardly, her left side absorbing most of the force.  Gritting her teeth against the pain, she pulled off her belt using only her good hand.  From there it was a collaboration with her left elbow to wrap the belt around her upper thigh as a tourniquet.  It finished a bit loose and sloppy, but at least she wouldn&#8217;t bleed to death&nbsp;immediately.</p>
<p>She knew, however, she was still going to&nbsp;die.</p>
<p>Worst-case scenario, the other two fled and she was discovered in the morning.  She would be sprawled in the garden, dressed in black with a soot-painted face, bristling with sharpened steel and poisons.  If the magister was dead, they would know she was an assassin and she would be killed.  If their mission had failed, the magister would assume she was one of the assassins and have her executed on the spot.  <em>Or, more likely, tortured first.</em>  Best-case, she would quietly bleed out in the night, managing to avoid the indignity of dulling a headsman’s&nbsp;axe.</p>
<p>But, regardless, still&nbsp;dead._</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t exactly how she&#8217;d imagined the night ending.  She and Kwoam had been sitting in the Pity and Bile weeks ago.  He had seemed excited.  He never seemed&nbsp;excited.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>We have a job,&#8221; he had hissed through a grin.  It had been months and they were almost out of&nbsp;money.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>What kind of job?&#8221; she had&nbsp;replied.</p>

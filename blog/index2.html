            <p>here’s the thought that just occurred to&nbsp;me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>technology greatly increases the commoditization of goods and&nbsp;services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossen%27s_laws">gossen’s laws</a>, we know that as commodity consumption rises, marginal utility eventually falls to zero and reaches maximum total&nbsp;utility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if total utility is zero (or even close to zero) amongst all things, there is no differentiation between similar goods and&nbsp;services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with no differentiation and the ability to consume goods and services ulitmately limited by time (the one, true finite resource), demand is also&nbsp;finite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supply-side economics is broken because it relies on temporary increases in total utility when total utility is already&nbsp;maximized.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>whew…  that’s about all the economic brain cells i have right now.  tho, feel free to point out weird missing strawman&nbsp;holes.</p>

            <h2 class="hue"><p>There’s been a lot of interest in how we’ve gone about acquiring our solar panels we installed last fall. I figured rather than write the same email over and over and such, I’d write up a quick post that might be helpful to other folks&nbsp;too.</p></h2>

            <p>going in, we had (and met) three&nbsp;goals:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>No added expense</em> - we didn’t want to be saddled with any extra payments and we assuredly didn’t want to trade liquid cash for a non-liquid asset. there was no way we wanted to wait forever for our investment to recoup. to avoid that, we calculated how many solar panels we’d need to leave our total monthly energy payment unchanged. so, the total of our loan payment added to the new power bill ($10 to $30 a month, depending) is less than or equal to our old power&nbsp;bill.</li>
<li><em>adding equity to our home</em> - talk about instant equity!  &#8220;here person buying our house, i hope you like your $15 a month electric bill!“  over the course of 30 years, that’s $54,000 in savings if energy prices stay the&nbsp;same.</li>
<li><em>saving money long term</em> - speaking of energy prices staying the same. did you know that power rates in 1990 out here were 9.9 cents per kilowatt hour? now, they’re 15.38 cents. yeah… that’s a 50% increase. and next year, they’re going up to 15.57 and the year after that, the power company is saying they’re going to be 15.61. for those keeping track at home, that’s about a 2% increase per year. not for&nbsp;us!</li>
</ol>
<p>you’ll notice i didn’t say &#8220;being green”, tho, that’s a nice side effect, it certainly wasn’t the driving reason. it’s funny how many people think we did it because we’re crazy californian hippies. makes me laugh. no, it has nothing to do with that at all. i mean, have you looked at your power bill&nbsp;lately?</p>
<p>joc did tons and tons of research prior to the install and we ended up choosing marie phillip at herca solar here in san diego (<a href="http://www.hercasolar.com">http://www.hercasolar.com</a>) – they were awesome and are highly recommended by us to anyone interested. just tell them joc and i sent&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>so, to recap: our monthly power budget at worst (until the loan is paid off) is a little less than before the panels, we added a ton of equity to the house and we’ve insulated ourselves from future power rate increases. win, win and&nbsp;win.</p>
<p>hell, all we need now is an electric car and we’ll be the hippies with the $15 power bill to your $200 one and our $0.00 a month fuel bill to your $200 one.
tho, i suppose at least you won’t be called a&nbsp;hippy.</p>

            <p>sorry i’m so late with this.  i know i <a href="http://twitter.com/m3mnoch/status/1426944801">threatened to write it up</a> last week, but, you know.  spare time being what it&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>anyway.</p>
<p>there are quite a few [smart folks[(http://andrewchenblog.com/2009/03/16/friends-versus-followers-twitters-elegant-design-for-grouping-contacts/) out there <a href="http://bokardo.com/archives/relationship-symmetry-in-social-networks-why-facebook-will-go-fully-asymmetric/">putting forth theories</a> on why followers (vs. friends) are the “right” way to go.  it’s good stuff.  you should read it as a preface to this.  it’s the kind of stuff i churn over all the time as chief web dude over at <a href="http://www.metaplace.com/">metaplace</a>.</p>
<p>the crux of the discussion is what’s better? friends or followers?  friends where, through granted requests, you explicitly create a two-way relationship with someone or followers where, by you “following” them back, you create an implicit two-way&nbsp;relationship.</p>
<p>and here’s my official thought, social media sites. (twitter, friendfeed, facebook, myspace, etc.)  so listen up — you need&nbsp;both.</p>
<p>here’s why: both methods, regardless of how they are implemented, are dual&nbsp;purpose.</p>
<p>purpose 1
you create an important relationship between you and another person.  you want to know what they’re doing.  you want to keep in touch.  it’s someone you care about.  you know — that whole “social”&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>purpose 2
it’s a scoreboard, man.  who has the most friends?  who’s the most popular?  who has the biggest network of contacts?  you know — a social&nbsp;leaderboard.</p>
<p>“so?” you&nbsp;say.</p>
<p>well.  it leads to a problem.  mostly, it’s all about the extra&nbsp;noise. </p>
<p>someone requests a friendship with you, either by clicking “add friend” or simply by following you, and you say “oh, i casually know that person” or “that was nice of them to follow me” and you confirm the&nbsp;relationship.</p>
<p>pretty soon, you have hundreds — even thousands in some cases depending on your notoriety — of&nbsp;friends.</p>
<p>well, as it turns out, <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2009/02/27/facebooks-in-house-sociologist-shares-stats-on-users-social-behavior/">that dunbar number isn’t really a lie</a> despite facebook’s best efforts.  you don’t really care intimately about all of those people.  but, there you are, with a huge polluted friends list that you can’t really trim down without looking like a huge douche.  (celebrities are mostly exempted from the “trim means douche” rule just because of the sheer number of fans they&nbsp;have)</p>
<p>you start dropping all those people you knew back in high school or your friend’s parents or whatever from your public friends list, you’re gonna get called on it.  just ask <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinrose">kevin rose</a>.</p>
<p>anyway.</p>
<p>this is a lot of words to really explain something pretty simple: we need to use something akin to the rss&nbsp;model.</p>
<p>you have private&nbsp;friends.</p>
<p>and you have public&nbsp;subscribers.</p>
<p>this still gives you a public scoreboard number that you can show off like a freakin’ <a href="http://www.cre8d-design.com/2006/03/subscriber-counts-the-new-hit-counter/">badge of honor</a> and yet, you still can have a smaller, more manageable list of “important people” that you care&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>subscriber is easy and carefree.  very asymmetrical.  like twitter’s followers.  you subscribe.  they subscribe.  everyone subscribes!  it’s free love and big points for all my friends!  … er… followers.  er…&nbsp;subscribers.</p>
<p>friends, however, is an explicit declaration by both people to “become friends” or promote the simple subscriber relationship to a full-on “lemme know <span class="caps">ALL</span> your dirt” relationship.  nobody outside of you two has to know about the relationship.  it can stay clean and&nbsp;pure.</p>
<p>best of all, it gives you a chance to filter the data accordingly. (this is where i pwn all you who are saying to yourselves “why not just use followers and groups, noob!”)  the data you care about is going to be different from friend to subscriber.  you have two different buckets where data pours&nbsp;into.</p>
<p>let us use facebook as an&nbsp;example.</p>
<p>raise your hand if you hate, hate, hate getting all the retarded app requests from every single person on facebook that you’ve friended.  <em>scans the room and sees everyone but crazy aunt hilda in the back has their hand&nbsp;raised</em></p>
<p>if you merely subscribe to someone, you wouldn’t get those.  you’d get explicit updates (comments, photos, direct messages, etc.) they put out, but not all of the app spam we all&nbsp;“love.”</p>
<p>all that goes into a subscriber bucket (prolly more like a lake, really) that you can dip your toes into and pull out memes or themes every now and then or just submerge yourself and let the noise of it all just wash over&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>however, your newly minted m3mnoch-proposed friends would be sending you full feeds of everything like normal.  all the subscriber stuff, plus app notes or anything else that they’re doing that would implicitly be interesting to you.  because, if they’re one of the 10 or 20 friends you actively follow and they update their facebook bowling app (is there really one?) with the turkey they just threw, dude — you wanna know!  cause you’re prolly playing the same game!  right now!  (i promise i won’t&nbsp;tell…)</p>
<p>…especially if that saves them the email they’d have to send to you bragging about it&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>and then!  then, you don’t have to worry about spammy updates!  the people who you are real friends with would now only include the people you’re prolly on im with all day&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>and once you can get the wires that tight, there’s all kinds of cool integration you can do.  automatic trust-type stuff you just can’t assume with today’s friending setups.  not to mention awesome data mining and discovery stuff you can assemble from a developer’s&nbsp;standpoint.</p>
<p>hell.  you might even be able to pull all that external im conversation onto your&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>i mean, wouldn’t it be nice to not have to worry about how many people billy sends an app request to because you would know that all his friends — not subscribers — are honest-to-god interested in&nbsp;it?</p>

            <p>i’ve been doing a lot of imagineering (man, i love that word) lately when it comes to web-based mmogs. lots of stuff running the gamut from super-secret ideas i can’t tell anyone about right now to general wonderings and&nbsp;observations.</p>
<p>well. i think i’ll just dump some of them out right here so i have them collected&nbsp;somewhere.</p>
<h2>subscription fees are choice&nbsp;inhibiting.</h2>
<p>paying those subscription fees certainly add up. i know you can say “well, just pay them for the 3 months you play and then get rid of&nbsp;them.”</p>
<p>no. it doesn’t work like&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>the thing with a subscription fee is that it represents commitment. there’s a high switching cost involved. and, since not very many people can afford to pay subscriptions for, oh, 15 games over the course of two years, you tend not to move on to those newer games. we basically have the wow effect where everyone is really only in a few&nbsp;games.</p>
<p>it really moves buying games into parallel with buying cars. you really like different models and styles, but, you have to make an informed decision about one — and only one — you’ll enjoy and use enough to make its acquisition worth&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>with non-subscription games, they are more like traditional media. more like movies or music. you just pop it in and play it whenever you want. you know that from purchase so there is no “will i use this in the future?” or “will i like this better than everquest?” or “will something better come along?”  the only factor is the “now” factor. how does buying it impact you right&nbsp;now?</p>
<p>non-subscription games are very much more pickup-putdown with no real switching cost. that lets you consume more game&nbsp;media.</p>
<h2>web servers are more conducive to a persistent online&nbsp;world.</h2>
<p>this one is tricky and i’m not going to try not to get too awful web-geeky on&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>the gist is that, for example, myspace.com has millions of concurrent users — all of whom can be on the exact same page at the exact same time. that is absolutely no different performance-wise than all of those million people being on a million separate&nbsp;pages.</p>
<p>not only performance, but the web is better at information dissemination than a graphical, high-visual&nbsp;client.</p>
<p>for example, if these million players were all in one place on a wow server (assuming of course the server wouldn’t go chernobyl on the situation) you wouldn’t really be able to pick out any one particular player to attack or inspect or what-have-you. with something like the singular, you can just ask them how many users per page you want to&nbsp;see?</p>
<p>i mean, has anyone ever seen how many google results come up for the word&nbsp;“page?”</p>
<p>oh sure, you say, but there’s an immersive, graphical richness that can’t be achieved with this silly text and lightweight graphical environment called the web. to that, i say, use the best-of-breed parts of both. use the data layout of a web page and the graphically rich aspects of flash for your deeper spatial relation&nbsp;needs.</p>
<p>the future of mmogs is going to be about ajax-enabled rest&nbsp;applications.</p>
<h2>event-based feedback consumable in sub-5 minute&nbsp;increments.</h2>
<p>as you may know, signing on and logging into wow may take you a while. hell, it takes 5 minutes on a good day to get logged into something you can actually&nbsp;“play.”</p>
<p>contrast that with 3 or 4 seconds to get to a play screen with travian. your login credentials are cached so all you really need is a bookmark to your village&nbsp;overview.</p>
<p>now, with that same 5 minutes you’re logging into wow, i can check guild messages, send appropriate reinforcements, build a new building, train some additional troops and send out a spy mission — and still have time left&nbsp;over.</p>
<p>that’s a lot of gameplay compacted into a short amount of&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>and, that’s the kind of stuff you just can’t do in a 3d&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>by the time you wander over to the auction house, i’ve already hit the marketplace, scanned the available trades, accepted a trade, sent merchants and moved on to planning my next action. and that’s only if you happen to be close to the auction house when we&nbsp;start.</p>
<p>now that we’ve decided that gameplay interaction is faster with a web-based mmog, what can we do with&nbsp;it?</p>
<p>well. what makes gameplay addictive? incremental goals and achieving them, right? well. now, we can have more. more incremental goals and they can be closer together. it’s called instant gratification and it’s a goddamn&nbsp;drug.</p>
<p>and, what quality makes a game permeate throughout your life? being able to get in and get out of the world instantly. how easy is it to check your inbox for new messages? how easy is it to check the box score of the game last night? how easy is it to check what google’s stock closed at today? how easy is it to see if your reinforcements got attacked in your&nbsp;alliance?</p>
<p>answer: super-easy. mere seconds&nbsp;even.</p>
<p>that turns playing a game into a “walk-by” experience. busy working around the house? on an excel document? writing an email? tv&nbsp;commercialing?</p>
<p>multi-task gaming. pop-in. pop-out. top of&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>and, we haven’t even touched the portability aspect.  connected to the same game on your treo 650?  yep, you sure&nbsp;are.</p>
<p>the web is the single most efficient content distribution channel in history.  mmogs, at their core, are just specialized, interactive content distribution in need of a super-efficient&nbsp;channel.</p>

            <p>this fake war is happening right now between game ‘journalists’ and game ‘bloggers.’ lemme&nbsp;explain.</p>
<p>i don’t really read much of gamespot, ign etc. anymore. i like reading the bloggers who write about games for a more honest, unbeholden-to-sponsors opinion. if i wanted paraphrased marketing spin, i’d just read the actual press&nbsp;releases.</p>
<p>that’s not to say those sites or magazines don’t have original content. they really do. a lot of the time, it’s even almost interesting. sort of in the only way those sites can be interesting. top 10 lists or game reviews. the narrow space where they can be critical of a game — by comparing them to other games. any mention of a company or any specific developers, tho, is always watered down. ‘this could be my opinion or that could be. objective journalism doesn’t let me pick tho. you have to&nbsp;guess!’</p>
<p>heh. even game reviews only float between 6.0 and 9.5. what’s the point of having 3’s or 4’s or 5’s if you never use them? shouldn’t 5 be average? according to a bell curve, shouldn’t the bulk of games be 5’s? personally, my rating system consists of one of three options: good games. mediocre games. and bad games. good, bad or indifferent. that’s the correct order of the&nbsp;universe.</p>
<p>but, i&nbsp;digress.</p>
<p><em>the problem is that traditional journalism is about unbiased facts. video game journalism is, however, subjective. therefore, not even technically&nbsp;journalism.</em></p>
<p>i want opinion. i want to be part of the meta-conversation about games. i don’t just want to consume industry marketing messaging. i want critical thinking done by these guys. i don’t want their half-assed attempt at portraying ‘the other&nbsp;side.’</p>
<p>i don’t think anyone like gamespot (i hate to pick on them in particular. feel free to insert your favorite ‘news’ site instead.) can really call sony out for being stupid. why would sony give them marketing co-op money in exchange for calling them dumb? what you end up with is a lot of tied-hands and flat, uninteresting&nbsp;‘reporting.’</p>
<p>that’s where this whole ‘new games journalism’ crap comes&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>heh. in case you couldn’t tell by my tone, i don’t really buy into the pretentious nonsense that is ‘ngj.’ it’s not about who can wax most esoteric regarding the minutiae of this love we call ‘interactive&nbsp;entertainment.’</p>
<p>no. just tell us what you thought. give us an honest opinion. that’s really all we want. if a game is crap, let us know. if it is simply average — despite it’s heritage — call it out. bring pain down upon those who dare to destroy our beloved icons! be interesting, not effusive. we don’t want to read poetry about some shitty game,&nbsp;man.</p>
<p>in other words, do what bloggers&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>we’re slanted. we’re opinionated. we’re jaded. that’s the beauty of it. collectively, all of the blogging voices make up a fairly balanced&nbsp;opinion.</p>
<p>no. seriously. hear me&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>for every blogger that loves some particular game or style of game, there’s another one who despises it. both are equally loud. both froth and spit bile about the opposing side. (well. the interesting ones anyway. the passionate ones.) if you are interested in balanced opinions, as a reader, you can review both opinions and make your own decision. the difference is that instead of a single writer trying to whitewash both sides in a single article. you have two blazing icons shouting the merits of their independent, even more diametrically opposed opinions. we’re loud and proud,&nbsp;baby.</p>
<p>the best part about video game bloggers? find someone you agree with and play what he plays. if your preferred flavors of games are entirely alike, then, they’ll never steer you&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>traditional game journalism, however, can’t do that. somebody out there thinks metal gear solid is a good game. i sure as hell don’t. holy boring, batman. if i wanted to watch a stealth/intrigue movie, i’d rent one. last time i checked, i was trying to play a game. not trying to figure out how to skip&nbsp;cutscenes.</p>
<p>i can say mgs sucked. traditional game journos can’t. because, for some gamers who are into that, well, it was a great&nbsp;game.</p>
<p>how do you rate&nbsp;that?</p>
<p>how do you give a concrete value to a subjective medium that will be equally applied to all your readers’ varied interests? that’s why movie reviewers are individual reviewers. the review is their opinion — not the magazine’s opinion. as an organization, the magazine is responsible for assessing games for someone who likes rts and someone who hates them. me? i think they are work, not fun. if the magazine says total annihilation is a 9.0 out of 10, does that mean i’ll like it? hell&nbsp;no.</p>
<p>movies are a similar thing. find a reviewer who tends to agree with you and go with it. who the hell cares what roeper (talk about an arrogant prick…. wow.) thinks when you always agree with ebert. (he is the absolute best movie reviewer of our&nbsp;time.)</p>
<p>you can do that with bloggers. they represent no one but themselves. bloggers are beholden, not to the conflict-of-interest inspiring advertisers on their site, but to their own integrity and pride of&nbsp;workmanship.</p>
<p>what am i saying? i guess i have no&nbsp;idea.</p>
<p>something along the lines of look to traditional game journalism for regurgitation. new game journalism for pretension. independent bloggers for honest&nbsp;opinion.</p>
<p>video game journalism is about opinion&nbsp;dammit!</p>
<p>i mean, c’mon! can’t we all just get&nbsp;along?</p>

            <p><span class="caps">INTRODUCTION</span>:</p>
<p>Binders are greater lords who bind together teams of warriors, train them, and then enter them into deadly combat with other Binders’ teams to fight for the ultimate title of Warbinder. Will you be the next&nbsp;Warbinder?</p>
<p><span class="caps">DESCRIPTION</span>:</p>
<p>You start as a fledgling Binder with only 8 lowly warriors under your control. Each individual Bound has a multitude of differing strengths and abilities. From here, you have a few options for building a well integrated team of mighty gladiators whose skills supplement and balance each&nbsp;other.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CAPTURE</span>:</p>
<p>You can get out and scour the world capturing, bribing or persuading fighters to join your cause. The method of capture you should choose will depend on the nature of the particular Bound you are trying to bring under your control. Some are more aggressive. Some are more&nbsp;crafty.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TRADE</span>:</p>
<p>Logging into the secure web site or through the game interface will allow Binders to connect and trade Bound with other Binders. Since the warriors have fixed cost values and variable training levels, the trade combinations are limitless. Perhaps you have trained your lowly Umglot to an amazing level, but he doesn’t fit well into the firearms team you are building. Trade him for a vastly more powerful, but not as well trained Nitarian Flame&nbsp;Sniper.</p>
<p><span class="caps">PURCHASE</span>:</p>
<p>Through secure online transactions, you can purchase groups of warriors outright. These “booster packs” will include a variety of untrained Bound based on rarity and point&nbsp;values.</p>
<p>Once you have built up your force, train your warriors well for soon it will be time to enter the coliseum for your first training battle. Carefully command your Bound during series after series of single player action against Binder configurable training Bots. Use the Bot control panel to tune the Bot’s combat abilities anywhere from a particular fighting style to general melee and train your Bound how to defeat them. Teach them combat formations and individual skills to counter any foe. The more you train, the better your Bound will be in live&nbsp;combat.</p>
<p>Then, log in, find a worthy adversary and put it all on the line for the title of&nbsp;Warbinder.</p>
<p>The huge metal doors hum and then slam shut behind your team of 5 well trained Bound. O’Keefe is your wolfman bristling with electro-static knives. Shahara begins to glow with armor made of light as she begins to cast a protection spell. Kongar, a monstrous barbarian, steps forward with his dual, humming battle axes. H’rathsis hovers near by as he readies the stinging spikes along his manta ray shaped body. And finally, Jake steps forward and racks his over and under double-barreled shotgun. He clenches his teeth, puts on his shades and says grimly, “Let’s get it&nbsp;on.”</p>
<p>On the far side, as your opponents enter the ring, you offer up a prayer that you have taught your team enough about teamwork – that you have taught them enough about each other – that you have taught them enough about themselves to not only come out alive, but to win. And then, someday, that they will make you a&nbsp;Warbinder.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GENRE</span>:</p>
<p>The game takes place in a world of techno-sorcery. Sweeping, flaming swords carve through concrete walls and mighty sorcerers battle against armored troops carrying shock rifles. Search far and wide for your future Bound. Trek through rolling hillsides and forests, in over populated hi-tech megacities or hike the deserts and canyons of the world of Galtaar. Home of the most powerful beings in the cosmos –&nbsp;Warbinders.</p>
<p><span class="caps">KEY</span> <span class="caps">FEATURES</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>100 different races and styles of warriors with different&nbsp;abilities.</li>
<li>Build complimentary teams based around strategic combinations of individual&nbsp;powers.</li>
<li>Train your Bound to a higher skill level to become more&nbsp;powerful.</li>
<li>Advanced learning <span class="caps">AI</span>.</li>
<li>Many different skills for characters to&nbsp;learn.</li>
<li>Shift characters around to build different&nbsp;teams.</li>
<li>Find, purchase or trade to acquire different&nbsp;characters.</li>
<li>Trade characters in the game environment or on the web&nbsp;site.</li>
<li>Research, inspect and arrange your team in game, on the web site or even on your <span class="caps">PDA</span></li>
</ul>

            <p>i thought i would share a piece i wrote about a million years ago — okay. actually only 5. i was feeling a bit melancholy after having written a pretty decent game design brief, shipped it off to bioware, had it swapped to lucas arts (in exchange for kotor) where it eventually became the xbox game&nbsp;“gladius.”</p>
<p>heh. with not even so much as a <em>pat</em> <em>pat</em> “nice&nbsp;work.”</p>
<p>man, i wish i had taken some screenshots of their ‘back of the box’ bullets when they first announced the title.  70% of them were god damn verbatim.  ah well. at least i know i can play at that level,&nbsp;eh?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Game development ideas are everywhere. Everyone has one. How many times have you and your friends been sitting around thinking to yourselves “Wouldn’t it be great if someone made this into a video game?” What if there was somewhere where you could put your ideas and have game developers actually take them under&nbsp;advisement?</p>
<p>This, of course, only works if two things happen. First, you have to be willing to share your “million dollar idea” and, second, game developers have to implement&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I hate to be the one to break this to you, but, that idea of yours may be original and unique and the best thing since sliced bread, but there isn’t a game developer in the world who will sign an <span class="caps">NDA</span> to listen to your idea. They get hundreds upon hundreds of “idea” submissions every day. Not to mention the ideas of their own. You have to build it yourself or it won’t get made. That is, unless you push it out there to the game development community at large and hope someone picks it&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>Now, if you can cover that part, we at Addicting Entertainment are hoping to cover the sharing of our collective ideas with the people actually building games. If your idea is clever enough to make it into a game, you finally get to actually experience your&nbsp;idea.</p>
<p>Here’s where you may want to just stop reading and opt out of any idea sharing:
We’re not in this to make money. Any ideas posted here are fair&nbsp;game.</p>
<p>By posting your “million dollar idea” you are turning it into a “zero dollar idea.” If some developer takes a fancy to your killer new idea for an <span class="caps">FPS</span> weapon, well, it sucks to be you. — In the monetary sense. You, of course, still retain the bragging rights to say “Dude! I posted my idea and id made it real! Woot!” You aren’t going to get paid for it. Not by us, nor (probably) by the game developer. Although, it would be nice if they publicly gave you a slap-on-the-back-you-rock-thanks. But they are not obligated to at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>You might be asking, “Well, dammit. Why the hell would I post my great idea then?” Our answer? Because you are a gamer. We all are. If you are in game development or thinking about being in game development for the money, you need to rethink your career. Sure, just like in the music business there are a few rockstars (pun intended) but also, like in the music business, the majority of us slave away at our labor of love for free or barely enough to eat. If you want to make money building software, move into enterprise level software development. Boring, but lucrative. Games are fun, but you’ll likely be piss-poor if you do it for a&nbsp;living.</p>
<p>So you might as well share with the community and advance the art and science of&nbsp;gaming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>here’s what i was thinking. i’ll make an open call for user submitted design documents. i’ll post a design brief in a bit as an example. i’ve set up a category for them. i’ll see if i can get a couple up there that i’ve got rolling around in my head. there’s just not enough time for me to make them all, so i might as well put them up here just in case someone else wants to build one or&nbsp;two.</p>
<p>not sure how many i’ll see, but it would be fun to find&nbsp;out.</p>

<p>Pulse Pounding. Head Swimming. Fingers flying manically across my keyboard. Scratching and scribbling noisily, struggling to find just the right&nbsp;word.</p>
<p>Damn this tiny tablet keyboard! My long, gangly fingers mis-stepping the entire way. I feel like I spend more time on the backspace key than actually poking at letters. Argh! Too&nbsp;late.</p>
<p>Sunshine. I need to go&nbsp;faster.</p>
<p>No! I need to concentrate on the next&nbsp;word.</p>
<p>Dinosaur! Got it! 10 points! I’m a&nbsp;genius!</p>
<p>Catching up to Seraphim now. It won’t be long before I claim that coveted top spot. Before I can reap the glory and spread the fear. Behold the giant:&nbsp;m3mnoch!</p>
<p>Um. How the hell do you spell “exuberant?” Wait! No one is going to use that as a tag. That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever&nbsp;thought.</p>
<p>Teeth. Simile…. Ack. <em>click</em> <em>click</em> <em>click</em> I meant Smile. No? Clown? 4&nbsp;Points!</p>
<p>Ranking is falling. There is only 46 seconds left in the round. I’ve fallen to 23rd. I don’t know if I can&nbsp;recover.</p>
<p>Think, dammit! Simple words. Descriptive&nbsp;words.</p>
<p>Fraudulent. What? Fraudulent? Where on earth did I come up with that one? Better yet, who in their right mind would tag a photo as “fraudulent?” And, how on earth did I spell that right the first time?  What?  Next photo already?
Sand! Yes! 8 points. Hanging steady at 23rd. Times almost&nbsp;up!</p>
<p>Erg. I have no idea on this one. 3… Banging out letters. 2… No! Not yet! 1… I can get&nbsp;it!</p>
<p>Too&nbsp;Late.</p>
<p>What? “<span class="caps">THE</span> Kevin Federline check out my site yo!” beat me? The absolute shame. I lost out in a competition of cognitive prowess to Kevin Federline? I guess there’s no chance Britney will shack up with me now,&nbsp;eh?</p>
<p>Is it really 9:30 already? Have I really been doing this for an hour? Wow. I need to pull up out of this swirling vacuum&nbsp;of….</p>
<p>Vacuum! I bet that was the last&nbsp;one!</p>
<p>Oops. New round. Gotta&nbsp;hurry.</p>
<p>Puppy? Paw? Fur! Yes! 7&nbsp;points!</p>

            <h2>The Hero&#8217;s Journey and Wage&nbsp;Slaves</h2>
<p>In the real world not everyone can be a winner.  Not everyone is successful.  I know it&#8217;s hard to believe, but there actually are people out there who don&#8217;t like their job.  The way real world economies are built depends on a lower wage class &#8212; the wage slave.  There has to be someone to work the low paying, thankless jobs from the garbage men to the guy at the counter at McDonald&#8217;s.  Not everyone can make absurd amounts of money just by essentially &#8216;showing up and having fun.&#8217;  If that happened, our economy would come crashing to its knees.  Inflation would rise uncontrollably until the dollar approached near&nbsp;worthlessness.</p>
<p>It would be just plain&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p>Game worlds don&#8217;t work like that though.  In a video game, everyone can be a winner.  In a video game, players want to have fun and win.  They have that right.  After all, they bought and paid for the game.  Why should anyone be expected to play a game where they are just one of the unwashed masses teeming with&nbsp;mediocrity.</p>
<p>Unlike in the real world they don&#8217;t have to battle each other to be the best.  They battle the environment and the monstrous inhabitants living there.  Each individual player is on their own Hero&#8217;s Journey.  They all are playing to become more wealthy and powerful and none of that really depends on the other players in the game.  It might in some small way, but, by and large, games are built to allow a single player to succeed without the help of anyone&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>Along each step of this journey, as they gain more experience and get more powerful, they are able to accumulate wealth easier.  This propagates economic models that show each player&#8217;s individual wealth and power grow on an exponential curve.  Goods and services provided in the game don&#8217;t.  And they shouldn&#8217;t.  If prices went up for these goods and services, lower level players wouldn&#8217;t be able to afford them.  They wouldn&#8217;t have any fun and the game would tank.  This causes inflation within the game.  More money, fewer products for you to spend it&nbsp;on.</p>
<h2>Money Sinks Aren&#8217;t&nbsp;Working</h2>
<p>To counter this exponential growth in wealth across the board, developers have tried to implement money sinks.  They are trying to siphon money out of the system with things like paying for transportation or paying rent on any property the player&#8217;s character might own.  The issue with this is that the sinks aren&#8217;t exponential and thus won&#8217;t match the character&#8217;s potential income.  The growth in wealth will always outpace the cost applied to these sinks.  Eventually, they will get to a point where the player is making so much money in the game that these flatly priced money sinks will essentially have no effect on their wallets and we&#8217;re back to the same&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>The developers could scale the cost of these sinks up, but that&#8217;s silly.  Just because my character is a higher level than yours, I have to pay a higher price for my equipment?  Even though it&#8217;s the very same equipment you are purchasing?  Shouldn&#8217;t that be the other way around?  With money comes power and influence &#8212; price discounts, not increases.  Regardless, not only are there metagaming ways around this weird price fixing (low level fences, for example) but, it&#8217;s just a terrible idea.  How many players do you know that enjoy paying arbitrary &#8216;taxes&#8217; in any game they&nbsp;play?</p>
<h2>Why Do We Have Two&nbsp;Currencies?</h2>
<p>The problem at the root of all this is the simple fact that a game has two currencies &#8212; experience points and money.  really, these days, we have to have three currencies.  two we earn and one we purchase with real&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>Sure the theory sounds like a greatgood idea, after all, you need more money to purchase better equipment so it should just balance out.  But, the player doesn&#8217;t need every suit of armor or sword they come upon.  Either their character can&#8217;t use it or it&#8217;s not as good as their current item so they sell&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>For example, you can kill 100 different monsters with a 10gp sword, but the items and equipment and money that come off of those 100 monsters are more than likely worth a lot more than the 20gp upgraded sword.  That, and along the way you are getting experience points for killing the monsters.  So, that 10gp sword gets more effective without anymore cost to the&nbsp;player.</p>
<p>In our example, it costs the player nothing to make fistfuls of gold and become more powerful.  That 10gp sword is netting huge <span class="caps">ROI</span> because of the multiplying effect of having these two currencies.  All this and it&#8217;s actually&nbsp;fun!</p>
<h2>Money Equals&nbsp;Power</h2>
<p>The simple solution is to tie money to power.  If experience points were inextricably linked to gold, it would negate the desire to stockpile the money and reduce us back down to a single currency.  If characters had to pay 1 gold (or however your currency breaks down) for each experience point, it would solve the problem.  You need to pay for&nbsp;power.</p>
<p>This will make money scarce again.  Does the player buy that new armor upgrade or do they put the money (in addition to experience points) into leveling up?  What&#8217;s the best part about that money spent on leveling up?  They aren&#8217;t buying anything they can resell and the gold required scales with power.  It essentially drops us back down to a single&nbsp;currency.</p>
<p>This levels the playing field.  Just because a character is a higher level doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean he can afford goods and services any easier than a lower level character.  Sure, it&#8217;s easier for him to make and hold money, but players should be able to make that decision.  Do you think they will want to hold the money and stagnate in their power or do you think they will spend that money on experience points and be broke&nbsp;again?</p>
<p>The idea of paying for training is essentially what we are talking about here.  It&#8217;s an ages old concept in games &#8212; one that was done away with in this age of instant gratification.  As it turns out, paying for training is actually a critical part of keeping the economy in check.  It gives those players somewhere to spend their&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>Buy better equipment or advance in levels?  It&#8217;s a fantastic choice to put to the player.  Chances are that the entire game is built around choices like that anyway.  Do you want the fireball spell or the strength buff spell?  More mana or more hit points?  This means it shouldn&#8217;t affect gameplay in any negative&nbsp;fashion. </p>
<p>In fact, it should actually enhance the gameplay by adding an additional strategic element to&nbsp;it.</p>

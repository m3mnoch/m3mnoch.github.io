Bearak didn&#39;t even have an interview with the kid, who was ducking him. The story was short, mostly about the issue. But Bearak had a fact that he withheld until the kicker. The fact put the whole story, subtly, in complete perspective. The kicker noted the true, wonderful fact that the kid was not in school that day because &quot;his ulcer was acting up.&quot; Meaning of life, 15 inches.",
